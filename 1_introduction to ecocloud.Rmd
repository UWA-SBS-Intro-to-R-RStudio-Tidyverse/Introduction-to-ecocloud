# Introduction-to-ecocloud


To run R we are going to use an RStudio server through a new service called ecocloud.

Each of you will have your own server and your own permanent workspace on ecocloud (10gb).


## Logging into ecocloud
Go to [app.ecocloud.org.au](app.ecocloud.org.au)

Log in using AAF (which will use your University credentials)

## Starting a Server
Once logged in you will be on the Dashboard

Go to Tools page

Click 'R (RStudio and Jupyter)' and follow the prompts to start an R Server. This will set you up on a virtual RStudio server in the cloud.


## Start RStudio and set working directory

Once your Server has started you will be on the JupyterLab dashboard.

Click on the RStudio box on the bottom right. This will open an RStudio session in a new tab.


This workspace folder is permanent, and will not be deleted even when you shutdown your server. You can also access this folder and itâ€™s contents from the ecocloud website.


## Access data from GitHub from within RStudio:
Access a GitHub repository and download a template for your code/data.

This step will download and save your data and files to your workspace so that they are available across the server

Open the Terminal window within RStudio

Type the following command:

cd workspace  "press RETURN"

git clone https://github.com/UWA-BIOL4408-Marine-Ecology/Template-lobster-density.git "press RETURN"


### Well done! you just cloned a git repository.




I suggest you this folder so that you can edit, make new scripts and annotate.
